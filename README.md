# CRYSTAL COLLECTOR

In this homework assignment, we've used everything that was learned so far to build a javascript game.

**Notes from Cami:** This assignment was much easier since I we were able to do the review session yesterday. I learned a few new things about my coding style. Additionally, I was able to watch a few videos that helped me understand the flow and thought process that I should have while coding.

# How to Play
* Object of the game is to match your score with target score
* Click on the crystals to add its value to your score
* If you match the target score, you gain one win point
* If you go over the target score, you gain one loss point
* Each crystal willl have a different value as the game resets
